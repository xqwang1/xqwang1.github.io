In this work, we have proposed 1) an analytical formula for accurate 
 calculation even when T1 recovery is incomplete; 2) a robust self-gating technique extracting respiratory motion signal from contrast-weighted raw data; 3) a calibrationless motion-resolved nonlinear model-based reconstruction for motion-resolved quantitative cardiovascular MR imaging.
