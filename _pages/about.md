Welcome to my homepage!

I am an MRI researcher, leading a group at the department of Radiology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. 

Our lab is generally interested in developing novel data acquisition and image reconstruction methods for motion-robust MR imaging as well as their clinical applications. Specifically, we are focusing on developing advanced, motion-robust techniques for quantitative fetal, neonatal brain imaging as well as cardiovascular imaging. 

We are a team of people with background in MRI physics, non-Cartesian acquisition, image reconstruction, motion correction and deep learning. 

We gratefully acknowledge the generous support of National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)!
