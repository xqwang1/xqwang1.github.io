Welcome to my homepage!

I am an MRI researcher, working with Prof. Berkin Bilgic at Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School. Previously, I had the fortune to work with Prof. Martin Uecker and Prof. Jens Frahm in GÃ¶ttingen, Germany. 

I am generally interested in developing novel image encoding and reconstruction methods for fast MR imaging as well as their clinical applications.
